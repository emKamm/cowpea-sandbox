## A pea by many names
The recording of these many monikers reveals much about the pea’s widespread use as well as the history of botanical study and its formation within various colonial empires. In European botany there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification.  More recently, taxonomists have been re-classifying the genus _Vigna_ and today all cultivated cowpeas are grouped under _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp._unguiculata_. However, it was well known as the cowpea throughout ancient Europe and Asia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike.

<span eid="Q1043"> Linnaeus (L.) </span>  gave this plant the scientific name _Dolichos unguiculatus_ in his <span eid="Q849308"> _Species Plantarum_ </span> of 1753 from a specimen from Barbados.

Ancient Greek physician <span eid="Q297776"> Dioscorides </span> knew of this plant and includes it in his herbal _De Materia Medica_  dubbing the cowpea "phasiolos". This name referred to any sort of bean or pea (these terms used interchangeably in Dioscorides' time).  
many Northern European botanists were somewhat uninformed about the plant, their knowledge based on others’ descriptions or on specimens entering their collection in unfamiliar conditions. Flemish Botanist <span eid="Q333372"> Carolus Clusius’s </span> influential 1601 _Rariorum Plantarum Historia_ (History of Rare Plants), for example, refers to cowpea as _Phaseolus peregrinus IIII_. This connoted a bean from the Americas considered foreign to Europe (peregrinus meaning stranger or foreigner, from the Latin _peregre_, literally per- ‘through’ + ager ‘field'). In Clusius’s remarks on kidney beans, he notes that he saw a drawing of the plant in the <span eid="Q699363"> 'Juliana Anicia Codex' </span> — the oldest surviving copy of Dioscorides’ herbal _De Materia Medica_. He notes that the Spanish have knowledge of the plant. <span eid="Q7322"> Christopher Columbus </span> observed kidney beans in the Americas — a white variety with a black center - which was easily confused with the black-eyed pea. Such ideas circulated throughout the seventeenth century.

For example, in a 1636 edition of English botanist <span eid="Q1333338"> John Gerard’s _Herball_ </span>, or _Generall historie of plants_, the author references Phaseolus peregrinus IIII, describing it as the “Indian Kidney bean with small white fruit.”*
